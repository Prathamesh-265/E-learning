You are a senior full-stack engineer and technical writer.
Build and explain a complete portfolio-ready full-stack project based strictly on the following requirements:

Project Name:

E-Learning Platform (Intermediate → Advanced)

Tech Stack (must follow exactly):

Frontend: React (Vite) + React Router

Styling: Tailwind CSS (preferred) OR CSS Modules

Backend: Node.js + Express

Database: MongoDB Atlas

Auth: JWT (access token + optional refresh)

Deployment: Frontend → Vercel, Backend → Render, DB → MongoDB Atlas

Testing: basic Jest + React Testing Library (minimum 1 component test)

1) Features to implement (must-haves)
Public Features:

Landing page (marketing copy)

Course listing page with filters: category, difficulty, price

Course detail page: overview, syllabus, instructor

User Features:

Signup/Login (JWT)

User Dashboard: enrolled courses + progress tracking (lessons completed)

Enroll in course (POST enrollment)

View modules/lessons (simple content pages)

Admin Features:

Admin-only panel

CRUD Courses: Create/Edit/Delete courses (protected routes)

View user list + enrollments

Backend/API Features:

Auth Routes

Course CRUD endpoints

Enrollment endpoints

Progress tracking endpoints

2) Required Data Models (MongoDB)

Implement these schemas:

User

{
_id,
name,
email,
passwordHash,
role: 'user' | 'admin',
createdAt
}

Course

{
_id,
title,
slug,
description,
price,
category,
difficulty,
thumbnailUrl,
lessons: [
{ title, contentHtml, videoUrl?, order }
],
createdAt
}

Enrollment

{
_id,
userId,
courseId,
progress: { lessonId: Boolean },
enrolledAt
}

Optional: Review { userId, courseId, rating, comment }

3) Required API Endpoints

Implement these routes exactly:

Auth

POST /api/auth/signup

POST /api/auth/login (returns JWT)

GET /api/auth/me (protected)

Courses

GET /api/courses (supports query: ?category=&search=)

GET /api/courses/:id

POST /api/courses (admin only)

PUT /api/courses/:id (admin only)

DELETE /api/courses/:id (admin only)

Enrollments

POST /api/enroll

GET /api/enrollments/me

PUT /api/enrollments/:id/progress

Admin

GET /api/users (admin only)

GET /api/reports (optional simple metrics)

4) Required Frontend Routes

Create these pages/routes exactly:

/ Landing

/courses Course Listing

/courses/:slug Course Detail

/login, /signup

/dashboard User dashboard (protected)

/admin Admin panel (protected + admin only)

5) Component Requirements

Create components:
Header, Footer, CourseCard, CourseList, CourseDetail, LessonPlayer,
AuthForm, Dashboard, AdminPanel, PrivateRoute/AuthGuard,
Pagination, FilterBar, EnrollmentButton

6) Security & Best Practices

Must include:

bcrypt password hashing

JWT expiry

store token in httpOnly cookie OR localStorage (mention tradeoff; httpOnly recommended)

role-based middleware

server-side validation + basic client-side validation

.env usage and env.example

7) Deliverables

Output MUST include:

Full folder structure (frontend/ backend/)

All source code for frontend and backend

README with:

features

setup steps

env variables

scripts

deployment steps

Postman endpoint list for testing

Clear explanation:

how the app works end-to-end

how auth flows work

how enroll + progress work

how admin CRUD works

Minimal test setup:

1 React Testing Library test

optional supertest API test

8) Output Style Rules

Provide code in complete files with filenames.

Keep code clean, modular, and production-grade.

Use consistent naming.

Add comments only where needed.

Explain project like an interview-ready explanation.

Now generate the complete project.
